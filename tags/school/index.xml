      <description>&lt;p&gt;This semester was very different than the previous semesters that I had in
college. Not being able to attend classes and interact with people for about a
year and a half seemed to have some kind of an impact that I did not realize
that I was having. Maybe that is why I was actually excited to come back to
campus! Obviously, things were much different - wearing a mask on campus,
supporting remote learning for the majority of classes, and another year of
online career fairs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
