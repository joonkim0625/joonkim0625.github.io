&lt;p&gt;Today, I finished my student work at Academic Support Resources (ASR) Custom
Solutions where I worked as a web developer for a year. Due to the pandemic,
everything was done remotely. There are so many things that I learned by working
with professional developers and I want to write down some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Agile way of work was something that I would always hear about, but I was
never involved with. According to Atlassian, it is &amp;ldquo;an iterative approach to
project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to
their customers faster and with fewer headaches.&amp;rdquo; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.atlassian.com/agile&#34;&gt;What is Agile?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
