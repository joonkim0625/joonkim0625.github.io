      <description>&lt;p&gt;This semester was very different than the previous semesters that I had in
college. Not being able to attend classes and interact with people for about a
year and a half seemed to have some kind of an impact that I did not realize
that I was having. Maybe that is why I was actually excited to come back to
campus! Obviously, things were much different - wearing a mask on campus,
supporting remote learning for the majority of classes, and another year of
online career fairs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;last-day-of-work&#34;&gt;Last Day of Work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I finished my student work at Academic Support Resources (ASR) Custom
Solutions where I worked as a web developer for a year. Due to the pandemic,
everything was done remotely. There are so many things that I learned by working
with professional developers and I want to write down some of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;agile-methodology&#34;&gt;Agile Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Agile way of work was something that I would always hear about, but I was
never involved with. According to Atlassian, it is &amp;ldquo;an iterative approach to
project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to
their customers faster and with fewer headaches.&amp;rdquo; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.atlassian.com/agile&#34;&gt;What is Agile?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
