      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was crazy enough to choose Arch Linux as my first Linux distro to start with -
when a lot of people recommend choosing user-friendly distros to begin with.
From creating a bootable USB to deciding what kind of programs to install so I
can have my laptop work, it took a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, somehow, I got into this thinking that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have a desktop
environment (DE) installed but wanted to install a window manager only! This, of
course, was me refusing all the comfortable features that DEs provide to users.
I messed up a few times and ended up reinstalling Arch over and over. Later, I
found out about Manjaro Linux which is an Arch-based distro that carries the
benefits of Arch with more user-friendly features! Manjaro definitely takes care
of some of the chores that I have to go through when installing Arch (of course,
I am a noob Linux user).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
