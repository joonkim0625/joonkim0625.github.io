What is DNS (Domain Name System)?

DNS resolves names domain names to IP addresses



Steps that DNS takes:



We try to access yahoo.com in our browser




The browser (or your OS) checks its own cache memory for IP Address




if not found, it sends the query to the resolver server


The resolver server is basically your ISP (Internet service provider)
Once it receives the query, it checks its own cache memory to find the IP
address to yahoo.com




if not found, it sends the query to the root server


Root server is the top, or the root, of the DNS hierarchy
13 sets of these root servers strategically placed around the world
operated by 12 different organizations
each set has their own unique IP address
when the root server receives the query for the IP address for
yahoo.com, it is not going to know what the IP address is. But, it
knows where to send the resolver to find the IP address. The root server
will direct the resolver to the TLD (Top Level Domain server) server for
the .com domain
Top Level Domain Server stores the address information for top level
domains such as .com, .net, .org etc.




TLD server is not going to know what the IP address for yahoo.com. So
it will direct the resolver to the next and final level which
are the Authoritative Name servers




The resolver asks the authoritative name server for the IP address for
yahoo.com


Authoritative Name Servers are responsible for knowing everything about
the domain including the IP address
when it receives for the query from the resolver, the name server responds
with the IP address for yahoo.com




Finally, the resolver tells your computer the IP address for yahoo.com
and your computer now can retrieve the web page for yahoo.com


once the resolver receives the IP address for yahoo.com, it will store
the IP address in its cache memory to prevent going through all these
steps again
